### Solution 

After opening the link we will find a circuit with simulation and a code

After simulating the circuit we find out that the led blinks with diffrent timing 
and with understunding the code we find out that it's a morse code msg

```bash

#define LED 2

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
   digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(1000);
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(1500);

}


```



What we understund from the code is that for hight delay (500) and low delay (500) it means a . 

```bash
 digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
```



And for High delay(1000)  and low delay(500) it refers to -

```bash
 digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500);
```

and for Low delay(1000) it means that the letter ended and the next is a new letter 
for low delay(1500) it means the end of the word 

this is the morse code that we manage to find
